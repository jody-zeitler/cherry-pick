cherry-pick
===========

Scrapes IMDB ratings for an entire run of a television series and plots them with gRaphaÃ«l

This tool allows the best episodes to be skimmed from lightly-serialized shows while maintaining the overarching continuity.

A Python script runs with a title query and gathers episode information into a tab-delimited file for spreadsheet manipulation and a JSON file for the graph. Each new show needs to be added to the select menu in the HTML.

Install
-------

The script is made for Python 3 and uses the Requests and Beautiful Soup packages, as saved in the requirements file:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
-----

	python cherry-pick.py [query] [seasons]

The **query** should be precise enough to ensure that the target show is the first result in a title query on IMDB. The **seasons** parameter can be a comma-delimited list or a hyphen-delimited range or a combination of both.

	python cherry-pick.py "red dwarf" 1,3,5-7
